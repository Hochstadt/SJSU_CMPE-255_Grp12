## Project Discription
This project looks at a set of data from the CalTrans PEMS repository of traffic density of San Francisco Bay Area freeways.
This data was compiled by Dr. Cuturi of UCI. (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00204/)
The goal was to train various models on a subset of the data and compare their performance in predicting what day of the week it is.

## How to run the code
Using Python 3.8, run the .py file in this repository. It will simply run through the analysis. Note that the code must be in a directory where it has write access as it will download the data from the web as a .zip file and decompress the data. The project was originally done in Google Colaboratory; please let the authors know if access is required for additional grading. The link is included in the .py file. Note that when plots are opened, they must be closed before the code will continue to run.
